### 👋👋 Hey! I'm Stephen!
![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=stephendongg)
I'm currently pursuing my M.S. at Cornell Tech, previously got my B.S.E. at Princeton. I love collaborating on projects and trying to take them as far as I can. I especially am attracted to projects that deal with the societal application of technology, leverage AI/Machine Learning, or somehow might make the world a better place. Please check out some of my [work](https://stephendong.notion.site) or reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephendong/) if you find my profile intersting!
