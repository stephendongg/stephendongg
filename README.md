## Hey! I'm Stephen!
I'm currently pursuing a M.S. at Cornell Tech in Connective Media (a mix of Computer Science, Behavioral Science, and Media Studies). I'm using this program to hone my skillset in applications of computer science and develop fluency in AI & ML. Before this I graduated Cum Laude with a degree in Computer Science at Princeton with a minor in Technology and Society. 
- I'm interested in societal applications of technology, AI and Natural Language Processing (just liked everyone else rn) and the interplay between technology and society. Please check out some of my [work](https://stephendong.notion.site) and connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephendong/) if you find my profile intersting!
